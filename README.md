# swiftshare.it

Share text and files with everyone, without complicated links. The user can specify a keyword, which will then be used for accessing the resources. For sharing multiple posts,
it's possible to set a namespace. To keep simple keywords possible, every post which is not bound to a namespace gets deleted after some time.

### Example
**Note: This project is not published. Therefore, the links are just how they would work.**

Without namespace
swiftshare.it/**keyword**

With namespace
swiftshare.it/**namespace**/**keyword**

### Features
* Create account
* Manage account
* Share text or files (called a post)
* Group posts using namespaces
* Automatic deletion of posts which are not bound to a namespace
